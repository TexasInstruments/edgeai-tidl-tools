    "# Image Classification Inference for High Resolution Images - ONNX Runtime\n",
    "In this example notebook, we describe how to use a pre-trained Classification model, using high resolution images, for inference. \n",
    "   - The user can choose the model (see section titled *Choosing a Pre-Compiled Model*)\n",
    "   - The models used in this example were trained on the ***ImageNet*** dataset because it is a widely used dataset developed for training and benchmarking image classification AI models. \n",
    "   - We perform inference on a few sample images.\n",
    "   - We also describe the input preprocessing and output postprocessing steps, demonstrate how to collect various benchmarking statistics and how to visualize the data.\n",

    "## Choosing a Pre-Compiled Model\n",
    "We provide a set of precompiled artifacts to use with this notebook that will appear as a drop-down list once the first code cell is executed.\n",

    "## Image classification\n",
    "Image classification is a popular computer vision algorithm used in applications such as, object recongnition, traffic sign recongnition and traffic light recongnition. Image classification models are also used as feature extractors for other tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.\n",
    "   - The image below shows classification results on few sample images.\n",

    "The diagram below describes the steps for ONNX Runtime based workflow. \n",

    "Note:\n",
    "- The user needs to compile models(sub-graph creation and quantization) on a PC to generate model artifacts.\n",
    "    - For this notebook we use pre-compiled models artifacts\n",
    "- The generated artifacts can then be used to run inference on the target.\n",
    "- Users can run this notebook as-is, only action required is to select a model.\n",
