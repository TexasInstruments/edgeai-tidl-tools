## Introduction 

TIDL provides multiple deployment options with industry defined inference engines as listed below. These inference engines are being referred as Open Source Run Times  in this document.
* **TFLite Runtime**: [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference) based inference with heterogeneous execution on cortex-A** + C7x-MMA, using TFlite Delegates [TFLite Delgate](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/delegates) API
* **ONNX RunTime**: [ONNX Runtime]( https://www.onnxruntime.ai/) based inference with heterogeneous execution on cortex-A** + C7x-MMA.
* **TVM/Neo-AI RunTime**: [TVM]( https://tvm.apache.org)/[Neo-AI-DLR]( https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr) based inference with heterogeneous execution on cortex-A** + C7x-MMA


>** *Please refer to the device TRM to know which cortex-A MPU* the device of interest contains

This heterogeneous execution enables:
1. OSRT as the top level inference API for user applications
2. Offloading subgraphs to C7x/MMA for accelerated execution with TIDL
3. Runs optimized code on ARM core for layers that are not supported by TIDL

OSRT offering also supports general purpose ARM-only OSRT inference capability for low-end TI devices with no C7x/MMA

## OSRT based user work flow 

The diagram below illustrates the TFLite based work flow as an example. ONNX RunTime and TVM/Neo-AI DLR RunTime also follow similar work flow. The user needs to run the model compilation (sub-graph(s) creation and quantization) on PC and the generated artifacts can be used for inference on the device.  
Note : Currently, pre-quantized models support is available only for tflite models.

## Model Compilation

![OSRT Compile Steps](../../docs/osrt_compile_steps.png)

Model compilation is supported only on PC. Follow the below outlined steps to perform model compilation:

1. Prepare the Environment for the Model compilation by following the setup section [here](../../README.md#setup)

2. Run for model compilation in the corresponding runtimes examples folder (examples/osrt_python/{runtime}) – This step generates artifacts needed for inference in the \<repo base>\/model-artifacts folder. Each subgraph is identified in the artifacts using the tensor index/name of its output in the model
```
cd examples/osrt_python/tfl
python3 tflrt_delegate.py -c
```

## Model Inference on PC (optional)

1.	Run Inference on PC using TIDL artifacts generated during compilation	- User can test the inference in host emulation mode and check the output; the output images will be saved in the \<repo base>\/output_images folder
```
python3 tflrt_delegate.py
```
2. Run Inference on PC without TIDL offload -  User can test the inference in host emulation mode without using any delegation to TI Delegate
```
python3 tflrt_delegate.py -d
```

## Model Inference on Device

The artifacts generated by python scripts in the above section can be used for inference using either python or C/C++ APIs. The following steps are for running inference using python API

![OSRT Run Steps](../../docs/osrt_run_steps.png)

1. Clone the repo on Device
2. Copy below folders from PC to device where this repo is cloned

```
./model-artifacts
./models
```

3. Run inference script in the corresponding examples folder on the device and check the results, performance etc.
```
cd examples/osrt_python/tfl
python3 tflrt_delegate.py
```

Note : These scripts are only for basic functionally testing and performance check. Accuracy of the models can be benchmarked using the python module released here [edgeai-benchmark](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-benchmark)


## User options for TIDL Acceleration

- **'options'** in the tfLite interpreter/ONNX inference session/TVM compiler call as outlined in [OSRT APIs for TIDL Acceleration](../../docs/custom_model_evaluation.md#osrt-apis-for-tidl-acceleration) are described below.   
- Options are common across runtimes. Any runtime specific requirements/constraints in terms of options are called out in below documentation.

- [^1]: Specifying layer_type as part of deny_list option :   
 Tflite runtime : Specify registration code as specified in tflite builtin ops - Please refer [Tflite builtin ops](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r2.3/tensorflow/lite/builtin_ops.h)  , e.g. "1, 2" to deny offloading 'AveragePool2d' and 'Concatenation' operators to TIDL.  
 ONNX runtime : Specify the ONNX operator name e.g. "MaxPool" to deny offloading Max pooling operator to TIDL
 TVM runtime : Specify TVM relay operator name e.g. "nn.conv2d" to deny offloading convolution operator to TIDL
- [^2]: ONNX runtime - In case layer name is not present as part of layer in model, output name corresponding to output(0) for the particular layer can be specified
- [^3]: Running TIDL-unsupported layers on DSP with parameter "c7x_codegen=1", requires Processor SDK 8.2 or newer. This feature has only been validated with selected models in TI's Edgeai-benchmark that are using the TVM flow.  We will continue to work on this feature
to improve the operator coverage and generate more performant DSP code.  If your model encounters problem with this feature, please set "c7x_codegen=0" and run the TIDL-unsupported layers on ARM.
